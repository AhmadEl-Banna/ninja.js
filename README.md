# React Interview

This project contains a simple React application to display a paginated table of users which can be filtered.

The required features are working and have already been implemented, but the implementation can be improved in many different ways.

Given the existing solution, refactor and tidy the code to what you believe would be a best implementation. The goal is to end up with a more flexible solution to be able to accommodate further required features. Focus on best practices when it comes to react/state management/clean code.

To get started:
- clone
- `yarn install`
- `yarn start`

To run the tests:
- `yarn run test`

During the interview, you will be asked to take us through your changes and maybe do some live coding on the spot.

# How to submit

1. Fork this repo.

2. Make a PR to your forked repo with your changes (make sure you make PR on your forked repo and not on this one - by default github will choose this repo as destination for PR)

3. If you chose to do public repo, send us link to the PR in your forked repo. If you choose to make private repo, add davidmilo, jacobjuul and kristiandupont as collaborators and send us link to it.

# Tips

Do not rewrite code to TypeScript. Purpose of this excercise is not to see if you can rewrite code to TypeScript.
